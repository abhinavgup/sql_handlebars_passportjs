client has to fine the path thrgh which it will transmit conenction to server

1)domain name like cb.lk


2)coding blocks.com

3) ip address

web sockets run on http 


client send a request to abc.com and gets respossne in form of a webpage

and there will be some js code on webpage which will alow server to crate socket connection

and if server accepts conection so apipeline btwn two will be created 


if we want to send a request form on end of pipe to another we dont need to find the ip adresss ot the path  again again

faster 


both ends of pipe can send or receive data 


socket.io is a library 


A can send data into pipeline using emit function and b will receive it in on function

run express app and socketio on http server


// create socketio instance on http server


script src="/socket.io/socket.io"    client side libray

this cript helps making global io function available to us 	


io()      function called on client so creates connection btw client and server

and io() return an object called socket(it is basicasllasy the pipeline)



io.on   
to listen when server conection is made
